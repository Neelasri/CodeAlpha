Task 2
Integrate Captcha with an existing Website.

Here I'm instructed to use a third party captcha service so I used google's recaptcha to do my task.
I generated site key to validate  the recaptcha.


Google reCAPTCHA:

Pros:

High accuracy in distinguishing between humans and bots.
Easy to integrate with a wide range of platforms.
Offers various versions, including "No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA" for a more user-friendly experience.
Cons:

Requires a Google account, which some users may be hesitant to use due to privacy concerns.
Google's policies and pricing may change over time.
hCaptcha:

Pros:

Privacy-focused alternative to Google reCAPTCHA.
Offers monetary incentives to website owners through the hCaptcha platform.
Customizable and easy to integrate.
Cons:

May have slightly lower recognition accuracy compared to Google reCAPTCHA (varies).
The monetary incentive model may not be suitable for all websites.
Custom CAPTCHA:

Pros:

Complete control over the CAPTCHA implementation.
Can be tailored to match the website's design and preferences.
Cons:

Requires more development effort and maintenance.
Potentially less effective against sophisticated bots.
